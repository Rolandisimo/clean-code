# Duplicated Code

Duplicated code is clearly a problem. It means that every duplicated part has to be in sync with the rest of the code and that you might get as many bug tickets as you have duplicated code.

It creates the risk of developers altering variable names, statement positions, etc and so covering the duplication without actually fixing it.

If you have duplicated code, fix it ASAP. Otherwise, it will bite you back like an unpaid phone bill.

When dealing with duplications, though, always remember this quote:
> ## **Wrong abstraction is worse than duplication**

This means that if you know you have a problem, but you don't have time to play around with it and you're not sure of how to best fix it yet, then leave it.

Mark it as `// FIXME:` and leave the office ðŸ¤«
