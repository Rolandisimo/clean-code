# Extract Function

## **Example folder 1**
Before example taken from a friends Typescript project.

### Benefits of this refactoring:
- Created several useful and reusable helper functions
- Reduced the complexity of the original function by moving this complexity and splitting it into several isolated parts
- Allows to focus only on the parts of the logic that matter e.g. only think of how to do `getEntry` and nothing else.
