I created this repository because I feel I'm not a genious coder and rarely have a lightbulb pop over my head after reading pages of dry theory.

Hence, examples is how I learn best. I believe this stands true for many others as well.

This repo is inspired from the books ["Refactoring"](https://www.amazon.fr/Refactoring-Improving-Design-Existing-Code/dp/0134757599/ref=sr_1_1?__mk_fr_FR=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&keywords=refactoring&qid=1563025987&s=gateway&sr=8-1) by Martin Fowler and ["Clean Code"](https://www.amazon.fr/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882/ref=sr_1_1?__mk_fr_FR=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&keywords=clean+code&qid=1563026066&s=gateway&sr=8-1) by Robert C. Martin.


## This is a WIP repo ü¶ê

# Structure
**Folder** | **Content**
:---: | :---:
code-smells | Contains .md files containing the description of the smell, bad and good examples, reasons for change, etc
refactoring | Folders named after refactoring techniques containing numbered example folders with before, after examples and tests. Usage examples of a particular block of code can be best seen in the test files.

# Content
Here you should be able to find most code smells covered, most refactoring techniques and clean code principles applied in action.

The refactoring techniques have example folders in no particular order. In them you'll have before, after and test files written in Typescript.

Part of the examples are from the books mentioned above while the other part comes from real life code examples.

# Disclaimer
This is not a definitive guide. Refactoring is always about compromising. Whether you agree with an approach or not depends on a multitude of factors - teams styleguide, how often a particular piece of code is changed, team sizes, roadmaps, etc.

With this said, this repo is meant to be as a guide and not a judge.
