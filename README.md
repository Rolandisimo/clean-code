I created this repository because I feel I'm not a genious coder and rarely have a lightbulb pop over my head after reading pages of dry theory.

Hence, examples is how I learn best. I believe this stands true for many others as well.

## This is a WIP repo ü¶ê

<h1> Structure:</h1>
For the first iteration the repository is going to be structured in a simple matter - a `src` folder with enumerated examples. This will allow other people to contribute more easily.

# Content
Here you should be able to find most code smells covered, most refactoring techniques and clean code principles aplied in action.

# Disclaimer
This is not a definitive guide. Refactoring is always about compromising. Whether you agree with an approach or not depends on a multitude of factors - teams styleguide, how often a particular piece of code is changed, team sizes, roadmaps, etc.

With this said, this repo is meant to be as a guide and not a judge.
